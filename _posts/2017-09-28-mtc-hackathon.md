Analyzing biological datas for neurotechnologies.

 The good thing with hackathon is that even if you don't understand the topics or speak the same language as your team mates, you will always learn new cool stuff and meet new folks. 

 I am currently studying in Moscow for a double degree  and one of the advantages for students in big city is that there is always an event to attend. I join some of my classmates of the HSE Data Science Master programm to participate in the **4D Hackathon** organized by **Mobile TeleSystems (MTS)**.

 Briefly what we did was analyzing electroencephalography -brain waves- datas  in order to compute the emotion of a human begin like stress or anxiety. On top of that, one of my team mate came with helmets he did in order to measure our own datas. This was crazy.

 I wrote an article about this event for **Read Square** which is a student magazine. The article can be found here : <a href="http://readsquare.ru/opinions/67"><button class="button">Article</button></a> and I really encourage you to read it if you want to know more about our project.

 For me it was really challenging as everyone there was speaking russian and I don't uderstand russian yet but thanksfully every one of my teammates spoke Python and Git so everything went fine, and we managed to have fun and learn new things at the same time :).
