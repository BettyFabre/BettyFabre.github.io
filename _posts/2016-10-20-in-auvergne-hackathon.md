Hackathon on Green Mobility

### New year, new adventures!

Sopra Steria organized its first edition of the In'Auvergne hackathon with ISIMA and the management school of Clermont-Ferrand. The students of both schools were divided into teams of 4 in order to work on the theme of Green Mobility

It was the perfect occasion for me to participate to my first hackathon and it was a lot of fun!

My team and I developped the prototype of a web application called "Décou'Verte" which aimed to help compagnies to organize easily "green" events for coworkers.

Being a beginner in web application development, I mostly worked on the design of the website with Bootstrap and the embedding and customization of a Google Map. While taking care of the front-end, my team mate from ISIMA worked on the back-end, developping the "events" database. The students from management school wrote a buisiness plan for the app.

We also had to work on a advertisement campaign for our application which took place on social media. We regularly shared advertisdment pictures of our application on Twitter. And this strategy actually made us win the communication prize!

It was for me a really good experience! I learned a lot from the hackathon itself, the github workshop or the Sopra Steria team advices. We were really tired but satisfied of the work accomplished and it will definitely not be my last hackathon :

Here is a little vidéo made by the Sopra Steria team during the event:
