a talk by William Durand

The Lava JUG of Clermont Ferrand hold an event dedicated to Git and Open Source Software on November, 26th. 

Interested in contributing to Open Source Software for quite a while, I decided to go there and learn a little bit more about how to contribute. 

During this event, William Durand, creator and contributor to several Open Source projects, gave us some coding tips and advices.

The talk was splitted in 3 parts, in the first and second he gave us a bunch of useful Git commands. On top of that he introduced us to Github and Gitlab. And finally he talked about Open Source, what open source is and how to contribute. 

Basically, everyone can contribute to open source projects. You just have to fork a repository, create a new branch and pull request the code!

To me, this event persuade me to involve myself in Open Source projects, and you probably will here from those soon.
