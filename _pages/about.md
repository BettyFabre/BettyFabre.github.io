I'm Betty and I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science. I work for Orange Labs and IRISA in Lannion, France.  
My research interests are **structured prediction** using **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning** and **imitation learning**. I used to work on computer vision problems, but currently I am mostly involved in **NLP** tasks. 

If you want to know more about : 
- my research, go to the [publication](/publications/) page. 
- my background, you can consult my [résumé](/resume.html).  
- my crazy adventures, here is my [blog](/blog/).

Besides working, I like to learn all kinds of things. 
I listen (and sometimes play) a lot of music and I have weird hobbies like mosaic, cooking and watching chess streaming on twitch even though I don't understand what's going on most of the time. I also enjoy reading essays and inspiring biographies and watching movies.
